            <p>
              One day, Professor Hannah Zong gave us what seemed like a simple assignment: 
              "Create a website that showcases your skills." Little did she know, this would 
              spark the birth of a cosmic coffee empire (well, at least a virtual one)!
            </p>
            <p>
              While other students were building portfolio sites, I thought, 
              "Why not create an intergalactic coffee shop?" And thus, Cosmobucks was born â€“ 
              where your coffee is literally out of this world. Professor Zong probably didn't 
              expect her assignment to result in a coffee company that serves espresso with a 
              side of stellar puns, but here we are!
            </p>
            <p>
              So thank you, Professor Zong, for inadvertently inspiring a coffee website that 
              takes "shooting for the stars" quite literally. This may not be a real coffee chain 
              (yet), but we're definitely serving up the most astronomical coffee experience on 
              the internet!
